Introduction
- I'm not a professional
- I'm not better than you
- This is IMHO
- Don't believe everything I say here
- I can make mistakes
- I don't do everything what I say
- If you will have questions, ask
- This is old project
- Not all review changes
- Sorry for my English

About project
- tell me :)
- Use it

Git / GitHub
- ReadMe https://github.com/jehna/readme-best-practices https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2 https://github.com/kurnakovv/NotSocialNetwork_Blazor
- gitignore without "VisualStudio", final: ".gitignore" (delete "bin" & "obj")
- Commit messages is long (50 symbols)
- Delete 'ed' from messages (Added -> Add) https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3580013/should-i-use-past-or-present-tense-in-git-commit-messages
- "Fixed some text in program" -> "Reduce request input text"
- Title: "Update file" is bad
- (CreatureSize) File must be end with enter (git blame https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31203001/what-does-git-blame-do)
  Why - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5813311/whats-the-significance-of-the-no-newline-at-end-of-file-log


Structure
- folder "enum" -> "Enum"
- Bussiness models -> folder "Models"
- Classes should be public


CreatureSize
- "Creature_Size" -> "CreatureSize"
- Numeration for enums (Enum flags https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8447/what-does-the-flags-enum-attribute-mean-in-c)
- namespace


Ancestry
- Properties Pascal case (camelCase, snake_case, PascalCase) https://google.github.io/styleguide/csharp-style.html
- Delete `= "undefined ancestry";`
- size -> Property
- Delete "...Bonus" ending
- type int -> enum https://stackoverflow.com/a/29485/22817151
- Constants


Person
- private
- readonly
- Delete nullable for _name
- new Characteristic -> new(), but delete it altogether
- Comment is useless (region)
- Rename GetInfo to Print (read about ToString https://learn.microsoft.com/ru-ru/dotnet/api/system.object.tostring?view=net-8.0)
- Use return GetInfo in return, do not depent on infrastructure
- SetCharacteristic is useless
- Extract Characteristic to separate file
- Correct indentations for ctor (merge conflicts https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/merge-conflicts)
- Do not use space before Methods/ctors


Characteristic
- Class structure: properties, fields, ctors, public methods, private methods
- Delete set
- Try to use only 1 word in names
- Rename GetModifierInt -> CalcModifier
- Rename GetModifierString -> PrintModifier
- (Math.Floor((decimal)(value - 10)/2)) -> Math.Floor((decimal)(value - 10)/2)
- modifierDecimal is bad name, because it contains a type in name (preModifier)
- Use spaces in formula: (value - 10)/2 -> (value - 10) / 2
- Use "{}" for condition body
- Use ternary operator if condition and logic are small


Program
- Input info so long
- Use IsNullOrWhiteSpace instead if (name == "" || name == " ")
- Person.Name is required
- Use validation for every field in Program (not in BL classes)
- GetAncestry -> CreateAncestry
- for -> while
- InvalidOption -> invalidOption
- Transfer 17 line to AncestryRepository class (List method)
- Constants


Will think
- GitHub Issues
- Transfer enums and models -> another project (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-new)
- Interfaces for Characteristic
- Validation properties (value object)
- Web API
